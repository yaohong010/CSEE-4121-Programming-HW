This is my programming homework set for the Columbia CSEE 4121, Computer System for DS.

There are 2 Programming assignments in total. We will be doing all the work on Google Cloud Platform. Main technology covered in these homework are BigQuery, Dataproc, Google Cloud Storage, Hadoop, Spark. All data are real-world data and some are subject to change in real time.

The 1st programming homework will be using BigQuery to do some analysis on Posts on Quora.

The 2nd programming homework will be using Spark and Hadoop to process and construct graphs from wikipdia data and implement Google's PageRank Algorithm.
